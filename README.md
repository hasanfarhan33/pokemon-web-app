   - Display Pokemon details including **name**, **type**, **height**, **weight**, and **evolution chain**.

3. **Favorites Vault**

   - Users can save Pokemon to their personal vault.
   - The vault lists all favorited Pokemon with their details.

## Known Bugs üêõ

Here are the following bugs that I have encountered during development:

1. After removing the Pokemon from the vault, the conditional "Add to Vault" button doesn't get updated. It should say "Add to Vault" but it says "Already in Vault" instead. I think it is because the favorites array isn't being updated in the global state at Vault Page after removing the Pokemon from the vault.
